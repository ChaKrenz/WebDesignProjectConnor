# Suggestions

- **Line 14** - What is the ultimate goal of this game? It seems like a good premise, but having a greater overall goal that the user is working towards throughout the entire game would help tie the whole game together.

- **Line 18** - Minimum age switched from age 15 and up to age 8 and up.

- **Line 19** - Please add more specification to controls (e.g., up arrow - jump, left arrow - left, right arrow - right, and any other controls like "E" for inventory or similar actions).

- **Line 30** - Where are these items going to be stored? Will the player collect them or use them right away?

- **Line 31** - Will the map generation be procedurally generated, or will it be the same each time?

- **Line 34** - What does the user gain by progressing through the game?
